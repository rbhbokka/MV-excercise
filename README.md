# MV-excercise
SwiftUI excercize implementing MV pattern.
I wanted to avoid over-engineering here and I believe most of SwiftUI projects don't need fancy architectures at all, framework itself provides better solutions. 
Model-View is enough.

App is utilizing swift-collections spm package becauseâ€¦ because why not? 
OrderedSet is a great way to check uniqueness while keeping collection in order.

Compiled and validated with Xcode 15.0.1 + iOS 17.0
It work on iPhone, iPad, Mac without any UX issues.
Colors and fonts are system native, so app look ok in dark and light mode.
